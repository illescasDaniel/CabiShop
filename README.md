# CabiShop

Simple shopping demo app built in SwiftUI using MVVM Clean architecture.

Compatible with iOS, iPadOS and macOS.

## Instructions:
1. Duplicate the file "build.xcconfig.sample" and change its name to "build.xcconfig" before opening the project.
2. Change the DEVELOPMENT_TEAM variable to your id or select a valid development team in Xcode.

If the "production" environment doesn't work because the "endpoint" was removed, try the Mock environment.
